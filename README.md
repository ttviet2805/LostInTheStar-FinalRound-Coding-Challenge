In this game, there are 2 or 4 teams lost in the star in the university. They are randomly reborned in a square matrix N x N with some cells are obstacles. To overcome the 
lost to comeback to their planet, they need to draw the color of cells by their own color: each team has their own color. In detail, team 1 has color red, team 2 has color green,
team 3 has color blue and the last team has color yellow.In one move, they can go to left, right, up or down without going to obstacle cells. 

Their tasks is to draw as much cell as they can to win the game in order to comeback to their planet.
